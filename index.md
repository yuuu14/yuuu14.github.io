## Projects
**Neural Machine Translation for Bangla and English**  
June 2020 - Oct 2020  
Machine translation task between Bangla language and English in Python  
- Select dataset from GlobalVoices and OPUS
- Use convolutional seq2seq as training and translation model, evaluate model using BLEU score
- After 100 Epoch, get loss score 0.0194, and for translation part have BLEU score 0.68

**Fake Face Detection and Model Attack**  
June 2019 - Aug 2019  
Defense against *DeepFake*, using deep learning methods to detect forged human facial data in Python  
- Use FaceForencis++ as dataset, CelebA as extra test set
- Use CNN model: 3\*3 convolutional layers, ReLU function, 2\*2 max-pooling layers
- Get 90% accuracy on basic dataset
- In order to increase the generality of model, use fine tuning. After 2 Epochs, raise 5\% accurary on CelebA

**Compiler for subset of C, written in C++**  
October 2018 - January 2019  
Compiler for the subset of C language, implemented by C++  
- lexical analysis: tokenize source code
- syntactic analysis: use LL(1) grammars to parse tokens
- semantic analysis: generate a AST tree

**Pokemon Game for C++ programming**  
October 2016 - January 2017  
The project based on the original game Pokemon, using Qt and developed in Windows 10 environment  
- Use classes to store informations of Pokemon
- Use Client-Server Model to implement sign up/login with Socket between client and server. Store client data on database (MSDB).    
- Design the animation effect of battle between Pokemons with Qt user interface.t can be **bold**, _italic_, or ~~strikethrough~~.
