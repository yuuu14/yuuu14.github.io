It can be frustrating getting feedback like *'ls' is not recognized as an internal or external command,
operable program or batch file.* when you trying to retrieve directory info under Windows.
Recently, the tasks I have been assigned should be developed on Windows 10, but my knowledge on cmd of windows
is quite shallow, so, I would like to write this post, listing a table to compare some of the most useful commands
between Windows and Linux, and maybe comment a bit on the os diff.


| win  | linux | function |
| ---- | ----  | ----     |
| dir /a | ls -a | get dir list or file |
